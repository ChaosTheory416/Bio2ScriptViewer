# Resident Evil 2 Script Viewer

## About

You can view the script files in the original Resident Evil 2 / Biohazard 2 as pseudocode next to the original bytecode. Every function is placed in a separate file to make it easier to switch between functions.

The script data is stored as part of the room description file (.RDT). There is one script that executes when the player initially enters a room and only executes once. There is a separate script that continuously runs while the player is in the room.
